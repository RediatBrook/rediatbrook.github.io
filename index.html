            <h1 class="govtext">Only 17% of Americans have trust in the Government</h1>
            <h2 class="govlong">This is alarming. Especially considering that the majority of the population (54%) had trust in the government as 
                late as 2001. Neighbourly aims to alleviate this problem by giving citizens a platform to take a more active role in 
            governance. This role could mean reporting community concerns over public infrastructure that requires restoration, a local
            initiative to develop a green area/recreation center, or a space to discuss issues of concern such as the rise of crime or lack
            of library access in a given area. <br><br>In the words of Pew Research, "When asked a separate question about the reasons why trust has declined
            in the past 20 years, people offer a host of reasons in their written answers. Those who think there has been a decline of trust in the federal 
            government over these two decades often see the problem tied to the government’s performance: 36% of those who see the decline cite this. 
            Some worry the government is doing too much, others say too little, and others mention the government doing the wrong things or nothing at all. 
            Respondents also cite concerns about how money has corrupted it and how corporations control the political process. President Donald Trump and his administration 
            are mentioned in 14% of answers, and a smaller share lays the blame on Democrats. Additionally, 10% of those who see decline lay fault at the feet of the news media.
            Those who think interpersonal trust has declined in the past generation offer a laundry list of societal and political problems, including a sense that Americans 
            on the whole have become more lazy, greedy and dishonest. Some respondents make a connection between what they think is poor government performance – especially gridlock 
            in Washington – and the toll it has taken on their fellow citizens’ hearts. Overall, 49% of adults think interpersonal trust has been tailing off because people are 
            less reliable than they used to be. "</h2>

                  <h1 class="govtext">75% of British Adults say they do not have a strong bond with their neighbours</h1>
                  <p class="govlong">Something that is quite concerning about this is that the survey was conducted before COVID-19.
                                    Close relationships between neighbours are crucial as they build a sense of unity and help create
                                    national consensus in polarised nations which many developed countries have now become. In addition
                                    to the bonds that users form through movements, Neighbourly connects people with similar
                                    interests in a locality through clubs. <br><br>Emma Elsworthy from the Independent has said of the problem, "Britain’s sense of community spirit is in decline, according to a new poll, which found that more than half of respondents barely said a word to their neighbours and 68 per cent describe them as “strangers”.
Two thirds admitted days can pass without them seeing others living on the same street, while 73 per cent said they didn't even know their names.
Half said they did not feel part of a “good neighbourly community” and nine in 10 admitted they never volunteer to help out with local charities and groups.
Only one in 10 said they would assist with a local tidy up, 12 per cent would help with a charity event and a four per cent would organise a fundraiser or attend a fun run.
Four in 10 said they felt no sense of pride about where they live and 84 per cent fail to participate in any local events.
<br><br>“It’s a shock and disappointment to discover that Britain’s community spirit – for so long a national feature which bonded people together – was in decline," said Roy Prenton, from Skipton Building Society, which carried out the survey. “Wouldn’t it be great to try and turn this around and help rebuild our communities to bring them alive again?
The study found 51 per cent of respondents had no idea what the children next door are called, while 55 per cent did not know what profession their neighbours work in."
